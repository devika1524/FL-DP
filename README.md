# üöÄ Integrated Federated Learning with Differential Privacy

A modular, privacy-first federated learning (FL) framework with differential privacy (DP) for secure, collaborative machine learning across sensitive domains.

---

## üåü Key Highlights

- **Local Training:** Models train on client devices‚Äîraw data never leaves the device.
- **Differential Privacy:** DP mechanisms protect model updates and user information.
- **Attack Resilience:** Robust aggregation and detection modules defend against poisoning and anomalies.
- **Plug-and-Play:** Clean APIs and modular design for easy integration into real-world apps (healthcare, IoT, finance).
- **Experiment Ready:** Includes scripts, datasets (MNIST, CIFAR-10), and logging for rapid prototyping and evaluation.

## üóÇÔ∏è Project Structure

```plaintext
/client      - Client-side training & DP modules
/server      - Server orchestration & aggregation
/attacks     - Attack simulation & defense
/evaluation  - Experiment scripts & visualization
/config      - Config files for experiments
/docs        - Documentation & guides
/scripts     - Utilities for demos & deployment
```

## ‚ö° Quick Start

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Clone & Set Up

```bash
git clone https://github.com/devika1524/FL-DP.git
cd FL-DP
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate      # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Configure Your Experiment

Edit or create a YAML config in `/config/` to set:

- Model parameters
- DP budget (`epsilon`, `delta`)
- Number of clients, attack settings
- Training rounds, batch sizes

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Launch Server

```bash
python server/server.py --config config/default_config.yaml
```

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Start Clients

On each client device or process:

```bash
python client/client.py --config config/default_config.yaml
```

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Evaluate & Simulate Attacks

Run experiments, evaluate metrics, and simulate attacks:

```bash
python evaluation/run_experiment.py --config config/default_config.yaml
```

## üí° Example Applications

- **Healthcare:** Hospitals train models collaboratively‚Äîno patient data leaves the premises.
- **Mobile Apps:** Personalized models (e.g., keyboards, recommendations) without exposing user data.
- **IoT Networks:** Devices learn usage patterns securely, preserving privacy.
