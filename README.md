# FL-DP
This project develops a reusable, secure, and privacy-preserving federated learning (FL) system integrated with differential privacy (DP). Unlike application-specific solutions, the system is designed as a modular framework offering clean APIs and configurable client-server modules that can be easily plugged into diverse distributed applications.
